## üìÅ File Naming Convention

- All problems are stored at the root level using the format:
  - `1.two-sum.py`: Solution file (generated by VS Code LeetCode extension)
  - `1.notes.md`: Notes and alternate approaches
  - `1.alt1.py`: Optional alternate solution (if needed)

---

## üß† Goals

- Solve and deeply understand each problem
- Add multiple solutions if relevant (e.g. brute-force, optimal)
- Track and reflect on progress in this README and notes files
